### Hi, I’m Mahatwa 👋  
I’m a **Mechanical Engineering student at UCLA Samueli** who enjoys turning ideas into **designed, simulated, and built systems**.

My work sits at the intersection of  
**CAD • simulation • prototyping • engineering intuition** —  
from **parametric CAD in SolidWorks and Fusion 360** to **simulation-driven analysis using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Autodesk Flow Design**.

---

#### What you’ll find here
- 🚗 **Design-driven projects** grounded in engineering fundamentals  
- 🧠 **Clear reasoning** behind design and simulation choices  
- 🛠️ **Modern engineering workflows**, from concept to validation  
- 📈 Iteration, testing, and learning — not just final outcomes  

---

### What I care about
I’m especially drawn to engineering problems that:
- reward **clean, thoughtful design**
- demand **iteration and validation**
- balance **theory with real-world constraints**

I enjoy working on systems where performance, manufacturability, and creativity all matter.
