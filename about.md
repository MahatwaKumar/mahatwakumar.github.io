## Hi, I’m Mahatwa 👋
I’m a **sophomore majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science**. I’m interested in **engineering design, CAD-driven development, and hands-on problem solving**, and I enjoy working in collaborative environments where ideas move quickly from concept to execution.

I’m especially drawn to engineering work where design decisions are informed by clarity, iteration, and real constraints—whether those are performance limits, manufacturability, or usability.

## What I work on
### CAD-driven mechanical design
A core part of my work centers on **parametric CAD modeling** and thoughtful design iteration. I’ve worked extensively with **Fusion 360** and continue to develop my workflow in **SolidWorks**, focusing on clean assemblies, modular design, and manufacturable geometry.

During my **CO-OPTS internship (Summer 2025)**, I:
- Developed internal and external design components for a final, marketable device
- Designed a product that was **modular, functional, and aesthetically considered**
- Iterated designs under real-world constraints involving assembly, usability, and refinement

### Hands-on engineering & fabrication
I strongly value learning through building and prototyping. I’ve worked with a range of **CAM tools and fabrication methods**, including:
- 3D printing (FDM, SLS, and resin)
- CNC milling machines
- CNC laser cutters and waterjet cutters

Fabrication has helped me better understand tolerances, fit, and the practical considerations that influence good design beyond the screen.

### Simulation-informed workflows
Alongside CAD and fabrication, I’m actively building a **simulation-first mindset**. My current focus includes:
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** for simulation-driven analysis
- **Autodesk Flow Design** for developing aerodynamic intuition and visual flow analysis

These tools help bridge theoretical understanding with system-level behavior and guide more informed design decisions.

## Academic foundation
At UCLA, I’ve developed a strong grounding in mechanical engineering fundamentals, including:
- Computer Aided Design and Drafting
- Statics and Strength of Materials
- Mathematics of Engineering (in progress)
- Electrical and Electronic Circuits (in progress)

Upcoming coursework includes **Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies** and **Fluid Mechanics**, which I’m particularly excited to apply to design and simulation-focused problems.

## Beyond engineering
Outside academics, I’m a **competitive sabre fencer** with experience at the **national and international level**. I have **represented India** in competition and earned **national-level medals**, reflecting years of structured training and competitive commitment.

At UCLA, I’ve competed for the university team on multiple occasions, finishing **1st place once and 3rd place once** in collegiate competitions. Fencing has been a defining part of my life and an important long-term pursuit.

I’m also deeply invested in **fitness and strength training**. I lift regularly and value maintaining a physically active lifestyle as part of my routine. Beyond sport and fitness, I enjoy music and creative pursuits, and I value activities that reward consistency and long-term dedication.
