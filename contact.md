## Let’s build something interesting

Whether it’s a **mechanical design challenge**, a **CAD-heavy project**, or a **research collaboration**, I’m always excited to connect with people who enjoy turning ideas into well-engineered solutions.

If you’re here because of my work — you’re already someone I’d like to talk to.
